Laboratory/msg/The lab is brightly lit, with a gleaming stainless steel table running nearly the length of the room. White cabinets line the walls, punctuated by floor-to-ceiling glass cases that display a combination of equipment. A fume hood lurks in one corner of the room. The table has two sinks and gas hook ups at the center. Nothing else rests on its surface; the space is immaculate, and you know that there is a place for everything, and everything is in its place./Desc2/Desc3/-1/1/3/-1/

President's Office/msg/THE BLOOD. WHY IS THERE SO MUCH BLOOD?!/A cherry desk that seems almost superfluous, since there's little to no paperwork to be seen. A deep burgundy leather desk chair, that reclines to an almost obscene angle. There are only two small table lamps - one near the door atop a wicker table that clashes with the rest of the room's executive motif, and another on the cherry wood desk with a long brass pull-cord. The absence of overhead light casts shadows into the corners, spilling under the desk and over top the framed black-and-white pictures on the wall. The deep purple curtains are drawn to one side, allowing the light from outside the second story window to paint the eastern wall. It highlights a lone filing cabinet, suspiciously locked and coated in dust.//-1/-1/5/1/
Dining Hall/msg/A huge hallway with long rows of stone tables leading to a raised dias where the king and nobles eat. The floors in between the tables are carved with the history of the fort as are the three stories of walls. In places on the walls windows break up the engravings and offer a viewpoint from various others areas. One of the long walls of the hall is a series of double doors leading to the storerooms and kitchens while both short ends are studded with doors leading into the corridors. The whole thing resembles a viking longhouse but carved out of stone in my mind. If I could place cooking pits and roaring fires I would./desc2/desc3/0/4/6/-1/
Courtyard/msg/Unclassifiable might be the best adjective to describe the central courtyard garden. True, it has many of the elements of a classic Santa Fe courtyard - heavily plastered walls with sensuous, rounded edges; deep, shady portals held up by peeled pine logs; a central fountain sparkling in the sun. Yet, somehow, Eden's garden doesn't come across as traditional. Maybe it's her restrained use of plants: Instead of the usual riot of annuals and perennials, Newman narrowed her plant palette to two pairs of gray-green 'Wichita Blue' junipers and a series of yellow 'Graham Thomas' roses. The result feels almost Tuscan or Provençal, and the paler-than-typical colors she's chosen for gravel, sandstone, and stucco reinforce this Mediterranean mood./desc2/desc3/1/5/7/3/

Throne Room/msg/As you walk into the palace throne room you can feel the power that emanates from the throne its self. The throne is a high back chair made of a deep dark oak finish with a red velvet cushion. The throne sits at the top of a three stepped platform which just adds to the Prestige of power that you feel. The rest of the room looks to be the same as the rest of the keep. High windows, many tapestries hang from the walls as well as a crackling fire to warm the room on those cold and dismal winter nights./desc2/desc3/3/7/-1/-1/
